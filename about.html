<h1> History</h1>

<p> The first meeting of this group was convened in the winter of 2013 by Marie Laport and Kendall Jackman.   Using the Brooklyn Organizers & Lawyers Collective as a model, our vision was to provide a space where organizers, lawyers, community leaders, and residents in the Bronx would build relationships across all of our issue areas and generate movement momentum.</p>

  <ul>
